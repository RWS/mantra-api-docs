# Mantra API Documentation #
## Getting Started with the Managed Translation API ##
This document helps you get started with the API's by following a project through its entire lifecycle from creation to completion:
1. Authenticate with the API
2. Create a project
3. Track your project
4. Approve the project and download the translated files
5. Mark the files as completed

This process and the available API calls are available in the **[Mantra API documentation](https://languagecloud.sdl.com/managed-translation/api#section/Getting-Started-with-the-Managed-Translation-API)**.

## Mantra User Documentation ##
